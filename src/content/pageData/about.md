  - title: More About 3TR
    text: 3RT Media was built around the idea that each step that we take and each decision we make truly reveals who we are and what we believe. It is when our actions prove our beliefs that our client base or ‘audience’ is willing to buy our products and services because their beliefs are similar to ours. Our mission is to help you as a company connect with your clients on a more personal level, and then show them what you have to offer. We bring your products and services to life, highlighting your customer’s lifestyle through customized videos created specifically for you and your company.
