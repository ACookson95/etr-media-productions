about: 
  - text: Simon Sinek simply stated, “People don’t buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe.” Empower the Rebel was built around the idea that each step that we take and each decision we make truly reveals who we are and what we believe. It is when our actions prove our beliefs that our client base or ‘audience’ is willing to buy our products and services because their beliefs are similar to ours. Our mission is to help you as a company connect with your clients on a more personal level, and then show them what you have to offer. We bring your products and services to life, highlighting your customer’s lifestyle through customized videos created specifically for you and your company.

  - text: Ben Barlow is a videographer based in Provo Utah with over 5 years of experience in his craft. Ben was first introduced to videography during his sophomore year at high school, editing a lightsaber battle that was painted frame by frame until the video was completed 3 months later. He has since grown from the videos he had created using Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro and is now using Davinci Resolve to create more cinematic and closer to life videos that can help spread positivity and change the world for the better. Through constant creation and a different perception on how most view the world, Ben has grown constantly seeking to push the boundaries on what is possible and what can be accomplished. You do not need to be signed by a label to create an album, you do not need to be contracted with a production company to film a full length movie, and you do not need anyone else’s permission to create the art that lives inside of you.
